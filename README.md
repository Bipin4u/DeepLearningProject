In India, where half the population relies on agriculture, early detection of plant diseases is crucial for maintaining crop quality and quantity. Traditional methods of detecting plant diseases often depend on human expertise and can be inaccurate. To address this, the proposed system uses deep learning techniques to classify plant diseases more accurately and efficiently.


### Importance
Plant diseases can severely impact crop yields and quality. Early and accurate detection is essential.
### Traditional Challenges
Manual detection is prone to errors and depends on the experience of the observer.
### Proposed Solution
The system employs a deep learning model, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transfer learning (using ResNet18), to automatically classify plant diseases from leaf images.
### Benefits
This approach is faster and more accurate than manual methods. It uses a pre-trained model and real-time processing on hardware like the Jetson Nano.
### Outcome
The system helps increase agricultural yield by accurately detecting and classifying plant diseases with minimal computational effort. It also offers a practical tool for farmers, providing timely information for better crop management.
